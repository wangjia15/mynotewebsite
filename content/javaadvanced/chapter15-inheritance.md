# Inheritance

Historically, inheritance have been the way to sell Object Oriented Programming.
It appears later that, inheritance is less important that it was envision first.

The initial idea is to be able to reuse part of the definition of one class `A`
to define another class `B` which is a kind of like `A`.
```java
class A {
}
class B extends A {  // I want to reuse and augment the definition of A
}
```

Precisely, inheritance is 3 different things grouped together 
- __subtyping__
  everywhere something is typed `A`, you can send a `B` instead
- __members inheritance__
  all instance members of `A` are copied in `B`
- __polymorphism__
  you can replace the code of a method from `A` to adapt it to `B`

## Subtyping
Subtyping is the most important part of the inheritance, it allows to reuse
an existing code written for an `A` with an instance of `B`.

let suppose, I have a method `sayHello()` for a `A`
```java
class A {
}
void sayHello(A a) {
  System.out.println("hello " + a);
}
var a = new A();
sayHello(a);
```

if I create a `B` that inherits `A`, then i can use instance of `B`
as argument of `hello()`.
```java
class B extends A {  // so B is a subtype of A
}
var b = new B();
sayHello(b);
```

__subtyping__ is very important, because it means that we can reuse a
method by calling it with several different types. And given that,
The more a method is used, the less buggy it is, _subtyping_ helps
to make applications more robust by sharing methods.


## Polymorphism
Polymorphism works with __subtyping__, __subtyping__ allow to call a
code with a subtype of the declared type. Polymorphism allows to
adapt parts of the shared code to the subclass at runtime.

By example, let suppose we have a class able to 'enhance' a text
by making it more beautiful
```java
class Enhancer {
  String enhance(String text) {
    return "_" + text + "_";
  }
}
void sayHello(Enhancer enhancer, String text) {
  System.out.println("hello " + enhancer.enhance(text));
}
var enhancer = new Enhancer();
sayHello(enhancer, "polymorphism");
```
 

```java
class StarEnhancer extends Enhancer {
  String enhance(String text) {
    return "*" + text + "*";
  }
}
var enhancer = new StarEnhancer();
sayHello(enhancer, "polymorphism");
```


So not only we can call `sayHello()` with a `StarEnhancer` (__subtyping__),
but inside `sayHello()`, the method call to `enhance()` will call
the methode `StarEnhancer.enhance()` adapting the code of `hello()`
to the fact that at runtime the enhancer is in fact a `StarEnhancer`.

The mechanism that choose the `right` method in function of the object
at runtime is called __polymorphism__.


### Overriding
In the example above, `enhancer.enhance()` inside the method `sayHello()`
can call `Enhancer.enhance()` or `StarEnhancer.enhance()`.
We say that the method `enhance()` of  `StarEnhancer` __overrides__
the method `enhance()` of  `Enhancer`.

A method to __override__ another has to
- have the same name
- have the same number of parameter
- can have a subtype as return type
- can have subtypes of the declared exceptions (`throws`).  


### `@Override`
You can notice in the code below that we are using the annotation
`@Override`. It is an annotation to document that the method
override an existing method. The compiler also verifies that
there is  a method in the base class with the same parameter types.
```java
class Enhancer {
  String enhance(String text) {
    return "_" + text + "_";
  }
}
void sayHello(Enhancer enhancer, String text) {
  System.out.println("hello " + enhancer.enhance(text));
}
class StarEnhancer extends Enhancer {
  @Override  // <-- aah
  String enhance(String text) {
    return "*" + text + "*";
  }
}
var enhancer = new StarEnhancer();
sayHello(enhancer, "polymorphism");
```

The annotation is not used by the runtime so it just make
the code easier to understand for a human.


### Calling a method using `super.`
The method that override another one can call the method it replace
using the syntax `super.enhance(...)`.
```java
class Enhancer {
  String enhance(String text) {
    return "_" + text + "_";
  }
}
class StarEnhancer extends Enhancer {
  @Override
  String enhance(String text) {
    return "*" + super.enhance(text) + "*";
  }
}
var enhancer = new StarEnhancer();
sayHello(enhancer, "polymorphism");
```


## Members inheritance
And last, when a class inherits from another one, then
all the fields and methods defined in the super class
are defined in the subclass.

Here by example, the field `name` defined in `Animal`
is also _implicily_ defined in `Lion`.
```java
class Animal {
  String name;
}
class Lion extends Animal {
  boolean young;
  void roar() {
    System.out.println(name + " roar");
  }
}
var lion = new Lion();
lion.name = "leo";
lion.young = true;
lion.roar();
```

This mechanism is controversial because if the implementation of
`Animal` change, the implementation of `Lion` has to be changed too.
So a super class and a subclass are tightly bound to the point
it's hard to maintain an application if the maintainer of the super class
and the sub class are not the same person.

> It's discouraged to inherits from a class you don't control.


### Constructor and inheritance
In Java, the initialization of the super class has to be done first,
before the initialization of the subclass.
It's mandatory that the first statement of the constructor of the subclass
to call the constructor of the super class.

With a class `Point`
```java
class Point {
  private final int x;
  private final int y;
  Point(int x, int y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
  public String toString() {
    return "x: " + x + " y: " + y;
  }
}
var point = new Point(1, 5);
System.out.println(point);
```

If the class `Point3D` inherits from `Point`, then the first statement of
the constructor has to be a call to the constructor of the super class
using the syntax `super(...)`.
```java
class Point3D extends Point {
  private final int z;
  Point3D(int x, int y, int z) {
    super(x, y);  // call constructor of the super class
    this.z = z;
  }
  public String toString() {
    return super.toString() + " z: " + z;
  }
}
var point3D = new Point3D(2, 4, 7);
System.out.println(point3D);
```

> Note: that unlike the other members of a class, constructors are not inherited.


## Members inheritance and encapsulation
We have seen that to have encapsulation, we have to declare the fields `private`.
But with inheritance, a private field declared in the super class is present
in the subclass but not accessible.

Here the field `roomPrice` is inherited in `Palace` but can not be accessed
in the method `price()` of the class `Palace` which doesn't compile 
```java
class Hotel {
  private final int roomPrice;
  public Hotel(int roomPrice) {
    this.roomPrice = roomPrice;
  }
  public int price(int rooms) {
    return rooms * roomPrice;
  }
}
class Palace extends Hotel {
  private final int extra;
  public Palace(int roomPrice, int extra) {
    super(roomPrice);
    this.extra = extra;
  }
  public int price(int rooms) {
    return rooms * (roomPrice + extra);  // don't compile !
  }
}
```

The usual practice is to declare the super class and the subclass
in the same package so declaring the field `roomPrice` with no keyword
make it visible to the subclass
```java
class Hotel {
  /*package*/ final int roomPrice;
  public Hotel(int roomPrice) {
    this.roomPrice = roomPrice;
  }
  public int price(int rooms) {
    return rooms * roomPrice;
  }
}
class Palace extends Hotel {
  private final int extra;
  public Palace(int roomPrice, int extra) {
    super(roomPrice);
    this.extra = extra;
  }
  public int price(int rooms) {
    return rooms * (roomPrice + extra);
  }
}
var palace = new Palace(100, 50);
System.out.println(palace.price(2));
```


### Field protected
In the code above, one can use the modifier `protected` too but
because a `protected` field is visible by any subclass even the one
the author of the subclass do not control. It means that the field
can not be changed the same way a `public` field can not be changed.

> Never use the keyword protected in Java.


## Relation with interfaces
Nowadays, inheritance is used less and less in Java because interface
provides __subtyping__ and __overriding__ without __members inheritance__.
Given that the later mechanism is the one causing trouble,
using an interface is often preferred to using inheritance.

### Records doesn't support inheritance
Records doesn't support inheritance because it's so simple to declare
a new record component that trying to share them will result into more
code that necessary.

Here is the class `Hotel` and `Palace` rewritten without inheritance
```java
interface Bookable {
  int price(int rooms);  
}
record Hotel(int roomPrice) implements Bookable {
  public int price(int rooms) {
    return rooms * roomPrice;
  }
}
record Palace(int roomPrice, int extra) implements Bookable {
  public int price(int rooms) {
    return rooms * (roomPrice + extra);
  }
}
Bookable hotel = new Hotel(100);
System.out.println(hotel.price(2));
Bookable palace = new Palace(100, 50);
System.out.println(palace.price(2));
```
 

## Use delegation not inheritance
Sometimes people are using inheritance where they should not !
The worst occurrences is when people want __members inheritance__
to avoid to write too many methods but forget that they get
all the methods even the one they don't want.

The problem is that if a class has a lot of methods, you are sure
that at least one will not work correctly with the subclass.

By example, this is a snippet of how the class `java.util.Properties`
is defined in JDK. Because it inherits from `Hashtable<Object, Object>`,
it means you can store a value which is not a String but get it as a String.

Obviously, it will not work at runtime
```java
class Properties extends Hashtable<Object, Object> {
  public String getProperty(String key, String defaultValue) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(key);
    return (String)getOrDefault(key, defaultValue);
  }
  public void setProperty(String key, String value) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(key);
    Objects.requireNonNull(value);
    put(key, value);
  }
}
var properties = new Properties();
properties.put("java", 42);
System.out.println(properties.getProperty("java", "??"));
```

The traditional advice is if you want to use part of an existing
implementation, instead of inherits from that class, store it
in a field and so your method can delegate a part of their implementations.

So for the class `Properties`, it should be implemented like this
```java
class Properties {
  private final HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
  public String getProperty(String key, String defaultValue) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(key);
    return map.getOrDefault(key, defaultValue);
  }
  public void setProperty(String key, String value) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(key);
    Objects.requireNonNull(value);
    map.put(key, value);
  }
}
var properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty("java", "best language ever, for life !");
System.out.println(properties.getProperty("java", "??"));
System.out.println(properties.getProperty("brainfuck", "??"));
```
